    Quantum Design Data File
description: >-
    A csv-based text data file created by Quantum Design physical property measurement
    systems and magnetic property measurement systems, containing the results of physical
    property measurements of various types. The  measurements may be the result of
    processing from additional raw data, e.g. raw SQUID voltage data in a Quantum
    Design .rw.dat file.
